Capstone Project Proposal

Title: Chartography

Description:A mapping app to find where you favorite chart topper (or indie band)
      is playing and when.

Elements & Functions: This application will combine together the result of a  
      search with the output of three API's.  It will use Songkick to locate when
      and where a concert by the desired Artist/Band will be and show that
      information using Leaflet. At the same time it will use Spotify to display
      a list of several songs by that Artist/Band so that the user can make sure
      thats who they really want to hear.

User Experience: Radio stations announce all the time when musicians will be
      going on tour. They even like to hype when an act will be coming to your
      local area. Of course today more and more people are getting their music
      from someplace other than local radio. What if your listening to I <3 Radio
      because you really like the Rock station where you went to college and they
      announce one of your favorite bands in concert there? You can use
      Chartography to look up exactly when that act will be there. Since its been
      a few years since you were last near your college campus you can then use
      the built in map to find exactly where that new auditorium is near your
      Alma Mater, and just because you want to hear their latest song, the search
      will find you it and a few of their old classics to boot.
